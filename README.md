Stock Price Performance and Industry Trends: A 10-Year Retrospective Analysis
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of stock price performance and industry trends over a 10-year period (2013-2022) for the S&P 500. Our goal is to provide valuable insights to investors by examining historical data to identify patterns and trends that could potentially inform future investment decisions.

## Features
Analysis of historical data from the S&P 500, focusing on stocks currently listed in the index.
Utilization of the YahooFinance Python library to obtain open, close, high, and low prices for each symbol annually.
Categorization of stocks by sector and evaluation of average year-over-year returns and intra-year volatility for each sector.
Application of statistical tests (ANOVA and linear regression) to validate findings and draw conclusions.
Key Findings
Information Technology, Healthcare, and Energy sectors yield the highest average year-over-year returns.
A correlation coefficient of 0.88 between the Average Annual Return and Average In-Year Volatility, indicating that higher returns are often associated with higher volatility.
Investors seeking higher returns in IT, Healthcare, and Energy stocks should be prepared for increased volatility and potential losses within their portfolios.
Lower-volatility stocks, which are generally considered safer investments, may offer less profit for investors.

## Limitations
The analysis is based on current S&P 500 tickers, and we could not find reliable historical data on the index membership for each year.
The study only covers a 10-year period and may not account for longer-term trends or fluctuations in market conditions.
